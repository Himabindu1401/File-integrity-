# File integrity
A Python-based tool to verify the integrity of files by generating and comparing cryptographic hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). 
Useful for detecting unauthorized file modifications, especially in security-critical applications.

# Features

- Compute hash values of files using various algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
- Compare current file hash with original to detect changes
- Simple and clean command-line interface
- Supports batch integrity checking of multiple files
- Easy to extend with additional hashing algorithms

  # Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `hashlib` (standard library)
- `os`, `sys` (standard library)
